\section {Purpose}


The purpose of the document is to help support the development process of the drink dispensing autonomous robot known as Alfred. In particular, this document will describe what tests have been performed to ensure that Alfred will be able to perform the act of navigating to and pouring drinks correctly. 

\section {Scope}
This document will focus on different software systems that have been discussed within the system design document. This document will focus on performing tasks on the system as if it was a black box, meaning the important aspects are the inputs and outputs of the system rather then the internal mechanics. For smaller sub-features, depending on the implementation, the code may have been considered when creating test cases to ensure the system is robust. 

\section{Background}

Alfred is designed to work with various different software systems, so that it can receive the desired drinks of the user, and be able to determine based on internal knowledge of the restaurant to be able to navigate by itself to the correct table. Alfred will then have internal containment units for beverages that will allow the user to put there cup into the drink dispenser to have Alfred pour there drink for them.\\

 Alfred will be able to receive the drink that the user that the user request by requesting the next drink from a designated server. This server will story any incoming drink requests form the mobile application. This mobile application is designed to be used on a tablet or mobile device, where the servers could sign in and give it a table identification number to allow Alfred know which table has sent this order.\\
 
 Management staff will be able to view Alfred's status from the computers within the back. This system will give the management the ability to modify tables, view the errors that the robot has sent, and will allow the management staff to call Alfred back to the home base.

\section {Test Cases}

\subsection{Testing Plan and Testing Factors}
Testing was performed based on the systems and sub systems that were defined within the software. Testing was down within a bottom up approach where small unit functions were first tested. Depending on the complexity of this unit, either white box or black box testing would be chosen. If the unit was complex, white box testing would be used based to help testing based on branch coverage. Black box testing would then be used for larger integration testing. \\

Testing was done over the following modules:

	\begin{longtable}{| p{0.2\textwidth} | p{0.8\textwidth} |}\hline 
				\rowcolor{tableCell}\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Test Plan Test Factors} \\ \hline
		Client Application & The main goal of testing the client application is to ensure that the experience is seamless for the customer. This means testing was done beyond just correctness testing. The bulk of the testing for the client application consisted of Usability and user interface testing. The server test cases tested the sequence in which API endpoints are accessed. Negative test cases for the client make sure that only the correct sequence of API access can be exercised.  Test numbers 01-05 focus on the pages which the staff will be interacting with (Login page and Settings page). Test number 06 tests that the customer cannot access the settings page without credentials. Test numbers 07-14 focus on testing all the components (buttons, number pickers, alerts and warnings) which the customer will be interacting with. \\ \hline
		Server & The main goal for testing the server is to make sure that all endpoints are functioning properly and return the correct results.The tests were split up into groups, based on the users of the server. Test sets within the entire test suite focused on enpoints to be used by the admin, the customers, and the robot. Another important part of testing the server was the sequence in which the endpoints were exercised. With the use of tokens and passwords, it was important to run those tests first and ensure that they went smoothly in order to proceed forward. In order for a customer to place an order, the table at which they are sitting must authenticate with the server and will be provided with a token to be used in later communication. \\ \hline
		Alfred Manager & Testing on this system was focused on unit operations working together. Test Cases were focused on Algorithms that would be used in terms of navigation. Other factors that were considered were the communication from the server to the robot as well as communication to the pumping system \\ \hline
	 	Alfred Drive-train & The main goal of testing with the drive-train system is to ensure reliability for motion in terms of navigation. Do to this, there has been a heavy amount of testing with the encoder and the open loop PWM voltage that goes to the motor, to ensure that motion is reliable and that the feedback signal is correct. From this, components were tested within a feedback loop to ensure that proper movement could be performed. Finally, the ultra sonic sensors were tested both on and off the moving robot to ensure that the system is safe if the user or something is in front of it.\\ \hline	
	 	Alfred Image Processing & The focus of the image processing system testing is within detection of circles and there proper location.  \\ \hline	
	 	Alfred Pumping System & The Alfred Pumping system focused on the mechanics of the pumps being able to receive and dispense the correct drinks, as well as detecting errors. In particular, the communication between the raspberry pi and the arduino, taking these values and dispensing the correct drink and ensuring that we are not out of liquids or that the liquids are at a non safe temperature. \\ \hline

\section {Beyond Testing}

\subsection {Code Walk-through and Code Reviews}
Code reviews were performed with at least two of the software team that had not wrote the code in particular. When a new piece of code would be pushed. A review request would be made and the person who wrote the code would help explain the functionality of the software to the other group members. From there, group members would be advised to ask questions about the software and would suggest changes if needed.

\subsection {static analysis}
Will be performed within future revisions.

\subsection { formal proofs}
Will be performed on the Motor control/Image processing within future revisions.

\section {Supporting Material}
