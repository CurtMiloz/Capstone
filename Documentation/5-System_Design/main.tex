\section {Purpose}

The purpose of this project will be to create an autonomous robot that will navigate to and serve
the requested drink to the user who requests a drink. Currently in an office setting, workers must
leave their offices to get their own drinks. Also, in restaurants, drinks are served by waiters and
waitresses, which hinders them from doing other work at that time. Alfred will be designed to make the serving drinks autonomous.\newline

Alfred will allow users to request drinks. These requests will form a queue which Alfred will serve in order using a FIFO protocol. Alfred will go to the table of each user and pour the drinks ordered from that table. Alfred will also have an administrator user which will be able to call Alfred back and override any action that is being taken at the time.\newline

The following document will outline the overall system components, as well as the overall system behaviour, operation and undesired error handling.

\subsection{Scope}

The system implemented is one that is meant to automate the dispensing of beverages to customers within a restaurant at the respected customers' table. The customer will be able to order a drink from their table which will be followed by Alfred arriving at their table and dispensing the requested drinks. The staff will be able to request Alfred to come back for charging and refilling when desired.

\section{Behaviour Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Ordering System Module} - Provided the order information, this module will communicate with the server to "order a drink".
	\item \textbf{Manager Login Page} - Given the login credentials, will authenticate administrator of the system with the server.
	\item \textbf{Manager Station Map Software Page} - Will allow administrator to create/modify the map of the area where Alfred will deliver drinks. This map will then be sent and stored on the server.
	\item \textbf{Manager Station Request Software Page} - Will allow administrator to execute commands for Alfred, as well as view incoming error codes from Alfred. Said commands, will be sent to the server, which will then communicate with Alfred.
	\item \textbf{Back End Web Service Module} - Will route communication to different components of the system. Also will be responsible for authentication and management of queue. 
	\item \textbf{Alfred Manager Module} - Endpoint for communication with Alfred. Will manage communication with server, as well as send any errors that Alfred is experiencing.
	\item \textbf{Alfred Drive Train Module} - Responsible for driving and managing the motors based on desired route. Also, will be send errors preventing movement to Alfred Manager Module.
	\item \textbf{Alfred Pumping Module} - Will control pumping system in regards of when to pour, how long, rate of dispensing, etc. Also, will be send errors of pump/container to Alfred Manager Module.
	\item \textbf{Image Processing Module} - Will detect any obstacles in the way as well as locate incoming nodes. Will communicate with Alfred Drive Train Module, to determine any required action based on results.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Description}
This module will provide power to the drive-train of Alfred. It will use the feedback of the left and right encoders and take the error to perform PI control on them. This PI control output will then be translated into a duty cycle for each side to be able to power the DC motors with pulse width modulation. This module will communicate to the image recognition software to receive the position of the next next marker and use this information of where it currently is on its path. This module will use ultrasonic sensors to get a set of distances ($ d_{object} $) to the nearest object to determine if it is safe to continue moving.

\subsubsection{Timing Constraints}
This module will have to deliver speed requirements that of walking speed so that it will be able to serve tables at a timely manner.

\subsubsection{Initialization}
This module will not be started until manager starts the process and initializes the proper information.

\subsection{Alfred Pumping System Module}

\subsubsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\textbf{Inputs: } 
\begin{enumerate}

\textbf{Outputs: } 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ LED_{drinksignal} $
	\item $ V_{pump } $
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Description}
This module will receive information from the Alfred manager module through UART to receive the next drink order. This will then begin to dispense the specific drink until it has reached $ m_{containerMin} $. It will then show the customer that the drink has been completed by turning on: $ LED_{drinksignal} $. It will then read $ b_{cuptaken} $ from a light sensor to determine if the cup has been taken at which point it will then wait for the next drink cup to get in place and begin pouring. If it is not able to pump liquid, or it is losing fluid when not dispensing, then it will send the appropriate errors through UART back to the manager.

\subsubsection{Timing Constraints}
This module will have to dispense the drink within $ t_{maxpump} $

\subsubsection{Initialization}
This module start by waiting for the manager to send the drink information for the system to pour. All errors within the system will start as false until they have been triggered.
\subsection{Alfred Image Processing Module Module}

\subsubsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\textbf{Inputs: } 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ pic_{ceiling} $
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Outputs: } 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ Marker_{PosX} $
	\item $ Marker_{PosY} $
	\item $ b_{NextMarkerFound} $
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Description}
This module will receive information from a camera while the drive-train is in motion. This camera will be looking at the ceiling looking for positions of circles that will denote one meter distances set up within a grid around the ceiling of the restaurant. This module will determine if there is a new maker within the image and if so where is the X and Y position of that marker to provide to the drive-train.

\subsubsection{Timing Constraints}
This information must process in time for the drive train to be able to navigate based off of it.

\subsubsection{Initialization}
This module start by the drive-train application.


\section{Normal Operation}
Alfred is a mostly autonomous robot, only requiring human intervention in the event of an error or warning. Alfred will be able to navigate the restaurant by itself, and will serve drinks to tables. Customers will be able to place orders via a mobile application, which will be sent to a server. Orders to serve will be sent to Alfred using a FIFO protocol. Once Alfred has finished with an order, it will be able to request for a new order to serve. Management will be able to recall Alfred to the kitchen at any point using the admin console. In the event of a recall, Alfred will finish the current job and will return to the kitchen afterwards. Management will also be able to create a map of the restaurant and upload it to Alfred, which will give Alfred the means to navigate the restaurant.



\section{Undesired Event Handling}
Alfred will be able to detect undesired behaviours and conditions such as low liquid levels below threshold $ m_{containerMin} $, any issues with pumping liquid, low battery level, leaking liquids, and any blockages in the current path once Alfred has been blocked for a time greater than $ obstruction_{timeout} $. In the event of any error condition, Alfred will send an error code to the kitchen, to alert the staff of the issue. Wherever possible, Alfred will return to the kitchen in an error condition to request a fix. Otherwise, if movement is not possible, the kitchen staff will have to pick Alfred up from the dining room. Along with alerting management of any current errors, Alfred will also be able to indicate whether it is returning to the kitchen or requires pickup.
